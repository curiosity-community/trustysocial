# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/default_avatar.jpg
    - assets/animations/loading.json
    - assets/animations/aianimation.json
    - assets/images/trusty-icon.png
    - assets/images/trusty-plus-icon.png

    - assets/images/icon-480.png
    - assets/images/icon-400.png

    - assets/images/google_logo.png
    - assets/images/error_image.png
    - assets/video/welcome_video.mov
    - assets/images/signup_background.jpg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: TwitterIcon
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/icons.ttf
    - family: HelveticaNeue
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeue.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeue400.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeue500.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeue600.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeue700.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeue800.ttf
          weight: 800
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeue900.ttf
          weight: 900
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaNeueIt.ttf
          style: italic

  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
